<h1>The Best Movies According to Evelyn</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Whisper of the heart</h3>
<p>This is the only ghibli movie that has a happy ending. I've fulfilled from the beginning to the ending scene. Such amazing pick for movie nights.</p>
<h3>Anne with an E</h3>
<p>Anne - the main character is such an icon. She is my inspiration, my muse. I've learned a lot of lessons from that Netflix serries.</p>
<h3>Gilmore Girls</h3>
<p>This series is great motivation for those who burnt out. Their conversations between characters are funny and insprirational at the same time. </p>
